I am a postdoctoral fellow with [Dr. William Noble](https://noble.gs.washington.edu/~wnoble/) in the Genome Sciences department at the University of Washington. 
Before this, I did my undergraduate studies at Biological Sciences department at Tsinghua University, and my graduate studies at Molecular Biology department at Princeton University, supervised by [Dr. Olga Troyanskaya](https://function.princeton.edu/).

I am interested in developing machine learning methods to tackle biology-related problems. 
I started as a wet-lab biologist in undergrad, where I used a series to experimental approaches -- including imaging, biochemistry, cell biology -- to study the autophagy process in human cell lines.
My graduate work is focused on integrating large scale biological datasets and applying network-based approaches to predict context-specific disease genes and pathways in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases and disorders.
My postdoctoral work are focused on integrating multi-omics single cell profiles across modality, time and species.
