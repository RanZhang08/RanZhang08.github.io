I am a UW Data Science postdoctoral fellow with [Dr. William Noble](https://noble.gs.washington.edu/~wnoble/) at the University of Washington. 
Before this, I did my undergraduate studies at Tsinghua University, and my graduate studies at Princeton University, supervised by [Dr. Olga Troyanskaya](https://function.princeton.edu/).

I am interested in developing machine learning methods to tackle biology-related problems. 
I started as a wet-lab biologist in undergrad, where I used a combination to experimental approaches -- including imaging, biochemistry, cell biology -- to study autophagy in human cell lines and yeast.
My graduate work is focused on integrating large scale biological datasets and applying network-based approaches to predict context-specific disease genes and pathways in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases and disorders.
During my postdoc studies, I am working on integrating and translating multi-omics single cell profiles across data modality, time and species.

My research interests include:
* Single cell cross-modality translation to impute missing data modalities
* Cross-species imputation to transfer knowledge in model organisms to human
* Reprioritization of disease genes using context-specific gene-gene relationship networks
* Data integration across data modalities, biological contexts, time, and species
